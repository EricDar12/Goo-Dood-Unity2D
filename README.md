    <p>Goo-Dood is a fast-paced 2D platformer inspired by Celeste, blending tight controls and challenging level design with fluid animation and engaging mechanics. This game marks my most ambitious project to date, showcasing my growth and dedication to game development since I started my journey last year.

    <h2 style="color:green"><u>An Emphasis on Movement</u></h2>
    <p>The backbone of any great platformer is its movement, this is especially true for games like Celeste, and by extension, Goo-Dood. In Goo-Dood, there is no combat or enemies—your primary challenge comes from navigating meticulously crafted levels. The difficulty and enjoyment of the game stems from the precision and creativity required to master the movement and overcome the obstacles within each level. This unique approach shifts the focus from traditional combat to the joy of overcoming complex, skill-based platforming challenges.</p>
